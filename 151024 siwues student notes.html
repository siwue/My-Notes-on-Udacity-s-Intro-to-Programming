							<h4 id="basics-of-the-web-and-html-intro">Introduction</h4>
								<div class="introduction">
									<p>
										The World Wide Web is a huge network of computers, that people use to access vast amounts
										of informantion. When somebody wants to access a document, he usually uses a browser to 
										request the desired information from a server. After having downloaded the document
										from the server, the browser will render the contents of said document.
									</p>
								</div>
							<h4 id="basics-of-the-web-and-html-concepts">Concepts</h4>
								<div class="concept">
									<h5>1. HTTP</h5>
										<p>
											When browsers communicate with servers, they use a protocoll called 
		            						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>. 
		            						HTTP is an acronym for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
		            					</p>
		            				<h5>2. HTML</h5>
		            					<p>
		            						The web consist of documents written in a language called 
		            						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>.
		            						HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language. 
		           					 		The code of an HTML document determines <em>what</em> a user will see (<b>content</b>), 
		            						and <em>how</em> he will see it (<b>markup</b>).
		            					</p>
		        					<h6>2.1. Elements</h6>
		        						<p>
		        							The contents of an HTML document are being marked up using <b>tags</b> and <b>attributes</b>. 
		      								Tags and attributes and the contents they refer to are called <b>elements</b>.<br>
		      								e.g. <code>&lt;tag&gt;content&lt;/tag&gt;</code>.
		  								</p>
		        					<h6>2.2. Tags</h6>
		        						<p>
		        							Tags are being used to tag elements as such. There are two different kinds of tags: 
		        							regular tags and void tags.
	        							 </p>
		      							<ul>
		        							<li>
		          								<b>Regular tags</b>. They require an <b>open tag and a closing tag</b>.<br>
		          								Examples of tags are the <b><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_b.asp">bold</a></b>, 
		      									or <em><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_em.asp">emphasis</a></em> tag.<br>
		        							</li>
		        							<li>
		              							<b>Void tags</b> do <em>not</em> require a closing tag. <br>
		              							Examples of void tags is the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_br.asp">line break</a>.
		        							</li>
										</ul>
		      						<h6>2.3. Attributes</h6>
		      							<p>
		      								Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. Two examples:
	      								</p>
		          						<ul>
		            						<li>
		              							The <b><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">image</a> tag</b>, 
		              							a void tag, provides the source of an image and a description that is being 
		              							rendered if the image cannot be displayed.<br>
		              							Exaple: 
		              							<code>&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CNzpXIUXAAAXSKn.jpg:large&quot; alt=&quot;
		              							A screenshot I tweeted, of Siri giving me a hint.&quot;&gt;</code>
		        							</li>
		            						<li>
		              							The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">anchor</a> tag, 
		              							a regular tag, that's being used to link HTML documents.
		            						</li>
		          						</ul>
		          					<h5>3. Stupid Computers</h5>
		          						<p>
		          							Always remember: <b>Computers are stupd</b> – they always interpret your instructions 
		          							literally. Therefore a typo in your code will break your document or program.
		        						</p>

		    						<h4 class="tip" id="basics-of-the-web-and-html-tips">Tips</h4>
		    							<h5 class="tip">Mind the Closing Tag</h5>
		    						<p>
		    							Keep in mind: if you forget the closing tag, a browser won't be able to display 
		              					your content correctly.
		          					</p>
		          					<h5 class="tip">Inline vs. Block</h5>
		          					<p>
							          	<b>Block elements</b>, such as <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>, 
							          	<code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code> 
							          	create a invisible box around the content within them; inline elements don't.

									<h5>1. Tools</h5>
										<p>
											There are some helpful tools for you to learn coding HTML: <b>Codepen</b>, 
											<b>Scratchpad</b>, and <b>Sublime Text</b>. Depending on the task at hand
											you will use one of these. Here's what you are going to use them for.
										</p>
										<div class="comparison">
											<div class="app">
												<h6>1.1. Scratchpad</h6>
												<p>
													<b>Functionality</b><br>
													Scratchpad is an instant HTML and CSS editor created by 
													<a href="https://twitters.com/nbashaw">@nbashaw</a>.
													It provides you with an easy way to write HTML and CSS and is fairly easy to understand.
												</p>
												<p>
													<b>Speed</b><br>
													It will render the code you enter in the left pane in real time in the right pane.
													Therefore you see immediately how changes to the code affect the style and structure 
													of your webpage.
												</p>
												<p>
													<b>Shareability</b><br>
													It is relatively easy to share the code you've created. However it does not match 
													codepen's focus on shareability.
												</p>
												<p>
													<b>Power</b><br>
													Scratchpad is a comparably lean and fast tool. It therefore lacks the functionality
													of a powerful editor like Sublime Text.
												</p>
												<p>
													You can find Scratchpad <a href="http://scratchpad.io">here</a>.
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="app">
												<h6>1.2. Codepen</h6>
												<p>
													<b>Functionality</b><br>
													Codepen, just like Scratchpad, is an instant editor. It is a bit more powerful and
													has a strong focus on sharing and collaborating on code. It has been founded by:
												</p>
												<!--I have NOT indented the following *short* <li> elements.-->
												<ul>
													<li><a href="http://twitter.com/alexquez">@alexquez</a></li>
													<li><a href="http://twitter.com/timsabat">@timsabat</a></li>
													<li><a href="http://twitter.com/chriscoyier">@chriscoyier</a></li>
												</ul>
												<p>
													<b>Speed</b><br>
													Just like Scratchpad Codepen will render your code in real time.
												</p>
												<p>
													<b>Shareability</b><br>
													Codepen is the perfect tool to conveniently share your code with the world.
												</p>
												<p>
													<b>Power</b>
													Codepen is more powerful than Scratchpad. It is easier to edit CSS, and you can 
													even add Javascript to your code.
												</p>
												<p>
													You can find Codepen <a href="http://codepen.io">here</a>.
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="app">
												<h6>1.3. Sublime Text</h6>
												<p>
													<b>Functionality</b><br>
													Sublime Text is way more powerful than Codepen or Scratchpad, and also more 
													complicated for beginners to understand. It doesn't run in a browser, but
													as a stand alone application on your computer.
												</p>
												<p>
													<b>Speed</b><br>
													Sublime Text doesnt offer real time rendering of HTML and CSS as Codepen and 
													Scratchpad do. One way to see your code in action is to open the respective
													HTML file in a browser. (Keep in mind that you need to keep accompanying
													CSS and JS files in the same folder as the HTML files for the page to render
													correctly.)
												</p>
												<p>
													<b>Shareability</b><br>
													It's a bit more complicated to share your code with Sublime Text, as it
													doesn't run in the cloud, but on your machine. So if you wanna share your
													code with the world you will need to upload it to the web first.
												</p>
												<p>
													<b>Power</b>
													Besides HTML, Java Script and CSS you can use it to write software in 
													powerful programming languages like Python, Ruby, C++ and the likes. It
													offers powerful features that make the life of a programmer easier. Examples: 
													Auto-complete, or advanced and customizable syntax highlighting.
												</p>
												<p>
													You can get Sublime Text 3 (which is currently in Beta) or free 
													<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">here</a>. If you intend using it for an 
													extended period of time, consieder supporting the developers by buying a license.

					<h3 id="add-style-and-structure-to-your-webpage">Add Style and Structure to your Webpage</h3>
						<h4 id="add-style-and-structure-to-your-webpage-introduction">Introduction</h4>
							<p>
								In this chapter you will learn how you can use HTML to add structure and CSS to add style to 
								your Webpage. You will learn how to <b>avoid repetition</b> in your code and why 
								<b>order matters</b>.
							</p>
						<h4 id="add-style-and-structure-to-your-webpage-concepts">Concepts</h4>
							<div class="concept">
								<h5>1. DOM</h5>
									<p>
										<b>DOM</b> stands for Document Object Model. The DOM is a programming interface 
										for HTML (and XML) documents. The programming interface provides a nested structure 
										of a document's content. In the case of html, all html elements are represented as 
										objects.<br>
										The DOM has a branching or «tree like» structure. It consists of one single, 
										well defined root and branches.<br>
										Whenever a browser loads an html document it creates a DOM of the document. 
										Based on the DOM other programs, like scripts, access, modify and, delete the 
										document's objects and their attributes if needed.
									</p>
									<p>
										Every HTML document has the exact same basic structure:
									</p>
									<!--Long <li> elements, therefore indented ;) -->
									<ul>
										<li>
											The <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration, defining the document
											type to be HTML.<br>
										</li>
										<li>
											The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>-tag, enclosing the code that describes the 
											HTML document.<br>
										</li>
										<li>
											The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>-tag enclosing information about the document.<br>
										</li>
										<li>
											The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>-tag, enclosing the code that describes the 
											visible parts of the document.<br>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<b>Example</b>
									<p>
										This is a sample code for a very simple webpage:
									</p>
											<!--I've written the code of this follwing section according to input from
											http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2820453/display-html-code-in-html-->
											<blockquote>
												<pre class="prettyprint">
													<code>
	
	&lt;html&gt;
	  &lt;head&gt;
	   &lt;title&gt;A very simple website&lt;/title&gt;
	  &lt;/head&gt;
	  &lt;body&gt;
	    &lt;h1&gt;The header of the very simple website&lt;/h1&gt;
	    &lt;div&gt;
	      &lt;img src=&quot;151121_udacity_notes_simple_dom_structure.png&quot; alt=&quot;tree diagram of a basic webpage&quot;&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;
	        Some very simple copy
	      &lt;/p&gt;
	    &lt;/div&gt;
	  &lt;/body&gt;
	&lt;/html&gt;
												</code>
											</pre>	
										</blockquote>

										And this is the visual representation of the nested structure of this very simple 
										webpage:<br>

			        			<h5>2. CSS</h5>
			        				<p>			        				
				        				The <b>look</b> of a web page is determined by a <b>CSS file</b>. CSS is an 
				        				abbreviation for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>. It allows you to define the
				        				style of elements in your HTML-document.
			        				</p>
			        				<p>
			        					To understand how CSS works, you need to understand the following concepts:
		        					</p>
		        					<!--Long <li>s-->
		        					<ul>
		        						<li>
		        							<b>Rule</b>: You can use rules to describes the value, that	a certain 
		        							attribute should take.
		        						</li>
		        						<li>
		        							<b>Class</b>: A <code>&lt;class&gt;</code> refers to a group of elements 
		        							that can be styled together. (Class names must never contain punctuation!)
		        						</li>
		        						<li>
		        							<b>ID</b>: An <code>&lt;id&gt;</code> is a unique identifier for an element
		        							in an HTML document.
		        						</li>
		        						<li>
		        							<b>Selector</b>: You can use selectors (a string) to identify or target 
		        							the elements that are assigned to a <code>&lt;class&gt;</code> or 
		        							<code>&lt;id&gt;</code> attribute in a HTML document.
		        						</li>
		        						<li>
		        							<b>Class selectors</b>: You can use class selectors to apply style to 
		        							certain elements, for example <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-headings.
		        						</li>
		        						<li>
		        							<b>Declaration</b>: The line of code that sets 
		        							<code>&lt;background-color: black&gt;;</code>, is a <b>declaration</b>;
		        							<code>&lt;background-color&gt;</code> is a <b>property</b>, and 
		        							<code>&lt;black&gt;</code> is the <b>value</b> of said property.
		        						</li>
		        						<li>
		        							<b>Cascading</b>: Cascading (or <b>inheritance</b>) means, that rules apply 
		        							not only to the specified element, but also to its child elements. If a child
		        							element has multiple overlapping rules, the more specific rule takes effect. 
		        							Inheritance allows you to write less code, thus save bandwith which translates
		        							into a webpage that loads faster.<br>
		        							Keep in mind: inheritance applies to text-related elements, NOT box elements.
		        						</li>
		        					</ul>
			        				<p>
			        					There are three different ways to apply css style to elements in your HTML document:
		        					</p>
		        					<ol>
		        						<li>
		        							You can define the style inline with your HTML code. This is prone to mistakes
		        							and generates a lot of repetitive code – in other words: it's a very bad way
		        							to style your document. 
		        						</li>
		        						<li>
		        							You can define the styles in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your 
		        							document. This works fine for small websites.
		        						</li>
		        						<li>
		        							The proper way to apply style to your document is by creating a dedicated
		        							CSS file. If you do this, you need to place a link in the 
		        							<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your document.
		        						</li>
		        					</ol>
		        					<p>
				        				The really cool thing abour CSS is: you can define the style of all instances of 
				        				a particular element. For example, instead of having to style each and every instance 
				        				of an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-element, you can define a style that applies to all 
				        				<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-elements. In other words, CSS allows you to 
				        				<b>avoid repetition</b>.
				        			</p>
		       					<h5>3. Boxes Everywhere</h5>
						        	<p>
						          		Everything on the web is wrapped in a <b>box</b>. When you structure a webpage, 
						          		you essentially	think about how an where on a given <b>grid</b> you want to 
						          		place your boxes.
						        	</p>
						        	<p>
						          		When you look at a simple webpage and want to figure out its structure, 
						          		it's best to do a screenshot start of it and then draw boxes around the
						          		various elements. Start with the biggest boxes and progress to the smaller ones.
						          		You can find an example <a href="151018_boxes_everywhere.pdf">here</a>.
					        		</p>
						        	<p>
						          		If you want to create a box, you can use block elements, like the 
						          		<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>-tag. After having created the structure of your document, 
						          		you can attribute style to your boxes. You can do this by adding attributes to 
						          		your tags or by seting up a CSS file, that defines the style of your various boxes.
						        	</p>
						        	<p>
						        		Boxes consist of four different areas:
					        		</p>
						        		<ul>
						        			<li>
						        				<b>Content</b>: This contains the image or text that is appearing on the 
						        				website. It sits at the center of the box and you can think of the other 
						        				areas as the content's protecting layers.
						        			</li>
						        			<li>
						        				<b>Padding</b>: The padding clears an area around the content. (It's affectd by 
						        				the <code>&lt;background color&gt;</code> of the box.)
						        			</li>
						        			<li>
						        				<b>Border</b>: The border goes around tha padding. It is ingherited by the
						        				<code>&lt;color&gt;</code> of the box.
						        			</li>
						        			<li>
						        				<b>Margin</b>: The margin clears the area around the border. It is completely
						        				transparent. It determines the space between boxes.
						        			</li>
						        		</ul>
						        	<p>
						        		CSS provides you with a useful model to work with boxes: css style 
						        		<code>&lt;box-sizing: border-box&gt;</code>. This allows you to set a max width to 
						        		your box that will remain the same, no matter how you change 
						        		<code>&lt;content&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;padding&gt;</code>, or
						        		<code>&lt;border&gt;</code>.<br>
						        		You need to remember two things:
					        		</p>
					        		<!--Long <li>s-->
					        		<ol>
					        			<li>
					        				<code>&lt;margin&gt;</code> is not included in the size of this size.
					        			</li>
					        			<li>
					        				You need to include browser specific prefixes <code>&lt;-webkit&gt;</code>, 
					        				<code>&lt;-moz&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;-ms&gt;</code>to your style for it 
					        				to work.
					        			</li>
					        		</ol>

			        			<p>
			        				You can add comments to your code that will be ignored by computers but can be read
			        				by humans. If you add comments to your code this will allow other programmers (or you) 
			        				to better understand your code - and thus work with it more efficiently.<br>
			        				Use the following syntax:<br>
			        				<b>HTML</b>: <code>&lt;!--comment--&gt;</code><br>
			        				<b>CSS</b>: <code>/*comment*/</code><br>
			        			</p>
			        			<h5 class="tip">Different Browsers, Different Style Sheets</h5>
			        			<p>
			        				Always remember: Different browsers use different <b>default style</b> sheets. That means 
			        				that the very same code might look different in different browsers if you don't define 
			        				proper style sheets covering all relevant elements of your HTML document.
			        			</p>
			        			<h5 class="tip">Flexbox</h5>
			        			<p>
			        				This is a really useful model when it comes to ensuring that your website looks good 
			        				on screens (size/resolution). Learn more about flexbox
